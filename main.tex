\section{Software Testing}

\subsection{Voyant}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Uploaded 12 PDF documents which I know have a similar theme and word use and argument style
    \item Voyant summarised the themes and frequent word and phrase use to my satisfaction. I can see how this will be useful at quickly and efficiently filtering documents which will be useful for me.
    \end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Zotero}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I have uploaded over 30 references from multiple locations onto Zotero.
    \item Using the citation and bibliography functions has solved the referencing problem I outlined in Scoping.
\end{itemize}

\section{Revision}

I had a chat with Brian and have decided that I may need to change my entire PoC if I am to get a higher mark for this unit. I am thinking of working on a PoC which will allow for version controlling my supervisor's feedback during my thesis and outputting the documentation into a supervisor friendly format (probably in a Word or PDF format). This will allow me to have achieve two things. 

First it will provide a rigorous version controlled history of my feedback and actions based on the feedback. Secondly, it will automatically generate a reader friendly version of the report of my actions based on my supervisor's feedback. My software of choice will most likely be a combination of Overleaf, GitHub, and cloudstor. I may also be using something like Terminal (Shell) on my Mac Book to allow for pipe-lining the text from the Overleaf document into a Word document and perhaps as a PDF as well.

\section{Software chosen}

For my first PoC I would be using Voyant and Zotero to solve my problems of oganising my papers and searching for themes in the filtration process when selecting papers and other resources.

For my potential updated PoC I would be using at least OverLeaf, GitHub, Shell, cloudstor, and either Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice.
